# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **Logger Directory Creation**: Created `src/utils/logger-safe.js` with no file system operations for serverless
2. **File Upload Directories**: Updated multer configurations in routes to use `/tmp` in serverless environments  
3. **Missing CORS Dependency**: Added `cors` package to `package.json`
4. **Serverless Handler**: Created `api/index.js` as a proper Vercel serverless function with safe logger
5. **Vercel Configuration**: Updated `vercel.json` to use the correct serverless structure
6. **Middleware Issues**: Replaced problematic middleware imports in serverless handler

## Key Changes

### 1. Safe Logger (`src/utils/logger-safe.js`)
- No file system operations
- Console-only logging for serverless environments
- Same interface as original logger

### 2. Serverless Handler (`api/index.js`)
- Uses safe logger instead of file-based logger
- Inline security headers middleware
- Proper database connection management
- Handles favicon requests

### 3. Vercel Config (`vercel.json`)
- Builds `api/index.js` with `@vercel/node`
- Routes all requests to the serverless function
- Removed conflicting rewrites

## Deployment

1. Commit and push all changes
2. Vercel will automatically redeploy
3. The new deployment should work without file system errors

## Testing

After deployment, test:
- `GET /` - API info
- `GET /health` - Health check  
- `GET /favicon.ico` - Should return 204
- `GET /api/auth/...` - Your API endpoints
